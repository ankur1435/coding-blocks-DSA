# CODING BLOCKS DSA

Welcome to the **CODING BLOCKS DSA** repository! 🚀 This repository contains my journey through **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, implemented in **Java** while learning at **Coding Blocks**. It serves as a personal collection of concepts, problem solutions, and implementations to track my progress and help others who are learning DSA.

## 📌 About
This repository documents my learning experience and provides Java code implementations for key DSA topics, including:

- **Arrays and Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Recursion and Backtracking**
- **Searching and Sorting Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graphs and Trees**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Advanced Data Structures** (Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, etc.)

Each topic contains:
- 📂 **Code files**
- ✅ **Problem solutions**
- 📜 **Explanations** (where necessary)

## 🎯 Purpose
The primary objectives of this repository are:

1. 📊 **Track my DSA learning progress**
2. 📖 **Provide a reference for learners tackling similar DSA problems**
3. 🧠 **Enhance problem-solving skills by revisiting and refining solutions**

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ankur1435/coding-blocks-DSA.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired topic folder.
3. Explore the solutions and understand the implementations.
4. Run the Java files to test the solutions.

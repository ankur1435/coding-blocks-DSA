# CODING BLOCKS DSA

Welcome to the CODING BLOCKS DSA repository! This repository contains the codes and solutions I have implemented while learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) at Coding Blocks. It serves as a collection of my progress, understanding, and the various DSA concepts and problems I will encounter throughout my journey.

## About
This repository is aimed at documenting my learning experience and sharing Java code implementations of important DSA topics such as:

. Arrays and Strings
. Linked Lists
. Stacks and Queues
. Recursion and Backtracking
. Searching and Sorting Algorithms
. Dynamic Programming
. Graphs and Trees
. Greedy Algorithms
. Advanced Data Structures (Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, etc.)
. Each topic contains code files, problem solutions, and explanations where necessary.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is:

1: To track my learning progress in DSA.
2: To provide reference material for anyone interested in similar DSA problems and solutions.
3: To improve my problem-solving skills by revisiting and refining the codes over time.

## Happy Coding!
